    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and whole spices, and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes soften.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir in the yogurt and garam masala, mixing well to coat the chicken with spices.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot, followed by 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the water.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it sit covered for an additional 10 minutes. Fluff the biryani gently with a fork.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh coriander and mint leaves before serving.</li>
